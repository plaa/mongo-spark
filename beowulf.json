Occasionally\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\n\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\n\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\n\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\nwhat has been beautifully called \"the clanging tread of a warrior in\nmail\"?\n\n[viii]\n\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\nTeutonic epic.\n\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\n\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the \"rime-giver\" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\n\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\nafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\nSievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\na variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |\nx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\n\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\n1_16 and 1_17: \"Lord\" and \"Wielder of Glory\"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\n\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\n\n[ix]\n\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\nthe story of the poem.\n\n\n_THE STORY._\n\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\n\n_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\nHrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\n\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\nGrendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\n\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\n\n_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\nwith him Grendel's head._\n\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\n\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\n\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\n\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\nhero of Geatland._\n\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\nadventure.\n\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A. March and James A.\nHarrison, for advice, sympathy, and assistance.\n\n                                                        J.L.

The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the\n    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new\n    sentence, but, for 'helmas bæron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This\n    has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a\n    kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new\n    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,\n    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the\n    water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been\n    coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out\n    'on the wall' in the last sentence.

Gr. and B. take it as an adv. modifying _etan: Will eat the Geats\n    fearlessly_.--Kl. considers this reading absurd, and proposes\n    'anforhte' = timid.--Understanding 'unforhte' as an adj. has this\n    advantage, viz. that it gives a parallel to 'Geátena leóde': but to\n    take it as an adv. is more natural. Furthermore, to call the Geats\n    'brave' might, at this point, seem like an implied thrust at the\n    Danes, so long helpless; while to call his own men 'timid' would be\n    befouling his own nest.\n\n    [5] For 'head-watch,' cf. H.-So. notes and cf. v. 2910.--Th.\n    translates: _Thou wilt not need my head to hide_ (i.e., thou wilt have\n    no occasion to bury me, as Grendel will devour me whole).--Simrock\n    imagines a kind of dead-watch.--Dr. H. Wood suggests: _Thou wilt not\n    have to bury so much as my head_ (for Grendel will be a thorough\n    undertaker),--grim humor.\n\n    [6] S. proposes a colon after 'nimeð' (l. 447). This would make no\n    essential change in the translation.\n\n    [7] Owing to the vagueness of 'feorme' (451), this passage is\n    variously translated. In our translation, H.-So.'s glossary has been\n    quite closely followed. This agrees substantially with B.'s\n    translation (P. and B. XII. 87). R. translates: _Thou needst not take\n    care longer as to the consumption of my dead body._ 'Líc' is also a\n    crux here, as it may mean living body or dead body.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"text":"XLII.\n\nWIGLAF'S SAD STORY.--THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.\n\n\n          Then 'twas seen that the journey prospered him little\n          Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden[1]\n          Down 'neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered\n          Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter\n        5 Was hotly avengèd. 'Tis a wonder where,[2]\n          When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of\n          Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may\n          Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.\n          So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,\n       10 Assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge\n          How his leaving this life was likely to happen.\n          So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did\n          Call it with curses--who 'complished it there--\n[104]     That that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,\n       15 Confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,\n          Punished with plagues, who this place should e'er ravage.[3]\n          He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder's\n          Favor preferred he first to get sight of.[4]\n\n{Wiglaf addresses his comrades.}\n\n          Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:\n       20 \"Oft many an earlman on one man's account must\n          Sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.\n          The liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on,\n          Kingdom's keeper, counsel to follow,\n          Not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let him\n       25 Lie where he long was, live in his dwelling\n          Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny\n          Hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,\n          Been gained very grimly; too grievous the fate that[5]\n          The prince of the people pricked to come thither.\n       30 _I_ was therein and all of it looked at,\n          The building's equipments, since access was given me,\n          Not kindly at all entrance permitted\n\n{He tells them of Beowulf's last moments.}\n\n          Within under earth-wall.

Let us rouse us and hasten\n[105]     Again to see and seek for the treasure,\n       45 The wonder 'neath wall.

No lot then decided\n          Who that hoard should havoc, when hero-earls saw it\n          Lying in the cavern uncared-for entirely,\n          Rusting to ruin: they rued then but little\n       70 That they hastily hence hauled out the treasure,\n\n{They push the dragon over the wall.}\n\n          The dear-valued jewels; the dragon eke pushed they,\n          The worm o'er the wall, let the wave-currents take him,\n[106]     The waters enwind the ward of the treasures.\n\n{The hoard is laid on a wain.}\n\n          There wounden gold on a wain was uploaded,\n       75 A mass unmeasured, the men-leader off then,\n          The hero hoary, to Whale's-Ness was carried.\n\n    [1] For 'gehýdde,' B. suggests 'gehýðde': the passage would stand as\n    above except the change of 'hidden' (v. 2) to 'plundered.' The\n    reference, however, would be to the thief, not to the dragon.\n\n    [2] The passage 'Wundur ... búan' (3063-3066), M. took to be a\n    question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his\n    appointed time had come.--B. sees a corruption, and makes emendations\n    introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or\n    from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of\n    daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hwár' and\n    dependent upon 'wundur': _A secret is it when the hero is to die,\n    etc_.--Why may the two clauses not be parallel, and the whole passage\n    an Old English cry of '_How wonderful is death!'?_--S.'s is the best\n    yet offered, if 'wundor' means 'mystery.'\n\n    [3] For 'strude' in H.-So., S. suggests 'stride.' This would require\n    'ravage' (v. 16) to be changed to 'tread.'\n\n    [4] 'He cared ... sight of' (17, 18), S. emends so as to read as\n    follows: _He (Beowulf) had not before seen the favor of the avaricious\n    possessor._\n\n    [5] B. renders: _That which drew the king thither_ (i.e. _the\n    treasure_) _was granted us, but in such a way that it overcomes us._\n\n    [6] 'Folc-ágende' (3114) B. takes as dat. sing. with 'gódum,' and\n    refers it to Beowulf; that is, _Should bring fire-wood to the place\n    where the good folk-ruler lay_.\n\n    [7] C. proposes to take 'weaxan' = L. 'vescor,' and translate\n    _devour_. This gives a parallel to 'fretan' above. The parenthesis\n    would be discarded and the passage read: _Now shall the fire consume,\n    the wan-flame devour, the prince of warriors, etc_.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"text":"ADDENDA.\n\n\nSeveral discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So.\nglossary. Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the\nAmerican editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I\nhope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall\ninto the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems\nbest to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.\n\n~From hám~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been\naltered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.\n\n~Þær gelýfan sceal dryhtnes dóme~ (440).--Under 'dóm' H. says 'the might\nof the Lord'; while under 'gelýfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'\n\n~Eal bencþelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-þelu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under\n'eal' he says _nom. sing._\n\n~Heatho-ræmas~ (519).--Under 'ætberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';\nwhile under 'Heatho-ræmas' he says 'Heathoræmas reaches Breca in the\nswimming-match with Beowulf.' Harrison and Sharp (3d edition, 1888) avoid\nthe discrepancy.\n\n~Fáh féond-scaða~ (554).--Under 'féond-scaða' H. says 'a gleaming\nsea-monster'; under 'fáh' he says 'hostile.'\n\n~Onfeng hraðe inwit-þancum~ (749).--Under 'onfón' H. says 'he _received_\nthe maliciously-disposed one'; under 'inwit-þanc' he says 'he _grasped_,'\netc.\n\n~Níð-wundor séon~ (1366).--Under 'níð-wundor' H. calls this word itself\n_nom. sing._; under 'séon' he translates it as accus. sing., understanding\n'man' as subject of 'séon.' H. and S. (3d edition) make the correction.\n\n~Forgeaf hilde-bille~ (1521).--H., under the second word, calls it instr.\ndat.; while under 'forgifan' he makes it the dat. of indir. obj. H. and S.\n(3d edition) make the change.\n\n~Brád~ and ~brún-ecg~ (1547).--Under 'brád' H. says 'das breite Hüftmesser\nmit bronzener Klinge'; under 'brún-ecg' he says 'ihr breites Hüftmesser\nmit blitzender Klinge.'\n\n[110]\n\n~Yðelíce~ (1557).--Under this word H. makes it modify 'ástód.' If this be\nright, the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong. See H. and S.,\nappendix.\n\n~Sélran gesóhte~ (1840).--Under 'sél' and 'gesécan' H. calls these two\nwords accus. plu.; but this is clearly an error, as both are nom. plu.,\npred. nom. H. and S. correct under 'sél.'\n\n~Wið sylfne~ (1978).--Under 'wið' and 'gesittan' H. says 'wið = near, by';\nunder 'self' he says 'opposite.'\n\n~þéow~ (2225) is omitted from the glossary.\n\n~For duguðum~ (2502).--Under 'duguð' H. translates this phrase, 'in\nTüchtigkeit'; under 'for,' by 'vor der edlen Kriegerschaar.'\n\n~þær~ (2574).--Under 'wealdan' H. translates _þær_ by 'wo'; under 'mótan,'\nby 'da.' H. and S. suggest 'if' in both passages.\n\n~Wunde~ (2726).--Under 'wund' H. says 'dative,' and under 'wæl-bléate' he\nsays 'accus.' It is without doubt accus., parallel with 'benne.'\n\n~Strengum gebæded~ (3118).--Under 'strengo' H. says 'Strengum' = mit\nMacht; under 'gebæded' he translates 'von den Sehnen.' H. and S. correct\nthis discrepancy by rejecting the second reading.\n\n~Bronda be láfe~ (3162).--A recent emendation. The fourth edition had\n'bronda betost.'

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
